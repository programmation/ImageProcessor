## ImageProcessor Needs Your Help

**ImageProcessor is the work of a very, very, small number of developers who struggle balancing time to contribute to the project with family time and work commitments. If the project is to survive we need more contribution from the community at large. There are several issues, most notably [#264](https://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageProcessor/issues/264) that we cannot possibly solve on our own.**

**We, and we believe many others in the community at large want a first-class 2D imaging library with a simple API that is not simply a wrapper round an existing library. We want it to have a low contribution bar which we believe can only happen if the library is written in C#. We want it to be written to cover as many use cases as possible. We want to write the same code once and have it work on any platform supporting CoreFX.**

**With your help we can make all that a reality.**

**If you can donate any time to improve on the project, be it helping with documentation, tests or contributing code please do.**

**Thankyou for reading this**

This is a complete rewrite from the ground up to allow the processing of images without the use of `System.Drawing` using a cross-platform class library. It's still in early stages but progress has been pretty quick.

###Why am I writing this?

With NETCore there is currently no version of `System.Drawing` to allow continued progress of the existing ImageProcessor library. 

### Installation
At present the code is pre-release but when ready it will be available on [Nuget](http://www.nuget.org). 

**Pre-release downloads**

We already have a [MyGet package repository](https://www.myget.org/F/imageprocessor/api/v3/index.json) - for bleeding-edge / development NuGet releases.

### Manual build

If you prefer, you can compile ImageProcessorCore yourself (please do and help!), you'll need:

- Visual Studio 2015 (or above)
- The [Windows 10 development tools](https://dev.windows.com/en-us/downloads) - Click `Get Visual Studio Community`.
- Dnvm and Dnx installed

To install the last two please see the instructions at the [DotNet documentation](http://dotnet.readthedocs.org/en/latest/getting-started/installing-core-windows.html)

To clone it locally click the "Clone in Windows" button above or run the following git commands.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageProcessor
```

###What might never happen
- Exif manipulation - There's a lot of quirks in parsing EXIF and I'd need a ton of help to get it all coded. [#78](https://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageProcessor/issues/78)
- Font support (Depends on new System.Text stuff) I don't know where to start coding this so if you have any pointers please chip in.

###API Changes

With this version the API will change dramatically. Without the constraints of `System.Drawing` I have been able to develop something much more flexible, easier to code against, and much, much less prone to memory leaks. Gone are using image classes which implements `IDisposable`, Gone are system wide proces locks with Images and processors thread safe usable in parallel processing utilizing all the availables cores. 

Image methods are also fluent which allow chaining much like the `ImageFactory` class in the Framework version.

Here's an example of the code required to resize an image using the default Bicubic resampler then turn the colors into their greyscale equivalent using the BT709 standard matrix.

```csharp
using (FileStream stream = File.OpenRead("foo.jpg"))
{
    Image image = new Image(stream);
    using (FileStream output = File.OpenWrite("bar.jpg"))
    {
        image.Resize(image.Width / 2, image.Height / 2)
             .Greyscale()
             .Save(output);
    }
}
```

It will also be possible to pass collections of processors as params to manipulate images. For example here I am applying a Gaussian blur with a sigma of 5 to an image, then detecting the edges using a Sobel operator working in greyscale mode.

```csharp
using (FileStream stream = File.OpenRead("foo.jpg"))
{
    Image image = new Image(stream);
    using (FileStream output = File.OpenWrite("bar.jpg"))
    {
        List<IImageProcessor> processors = new List<IImageProcessor>()
        {
            new GuassianBlur(5),
            new Sobel { Greyscale = true }
        };

        image.Process(processors.ToArray())
             .Save(output);
    }
}
```
Individual processors can be initialised and apply processing against images. This allows nesting which will allow the powerful combination of processing methods:

```csharp
new Brightness(50).Apply(sourceImage, targetImage, sourceImage.Bounds);
```

All in all this should allow image processing to be much more accessible to developers which has always been my goal from the start.

###How can you help?

Please... Spread the word, contribute algorithms, submit performance improvements, unit tests. Help me set up CI for nightly releases. 

Performance is a biggie, if you know anything about the new vector types and can apply some fancy new stuff with that it would be awesome. 

There's a lot of developers out there who could write this stuff a lot better and faster than I and I would love to see what we collectively can come up with so please, if you can help in any way it would be most welcome and benificial for all.
